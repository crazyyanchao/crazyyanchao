## 𝑨𝒃𝒐𝒖𝒕 𝑴𝒆
My career reflects my core values: an enduring commitment to lifelong learning, a deep dedication to environmental stewardship, and an insatiable curiosity that drives my exploration and innovation. These values guide my work across various domains.

I have written some programs to help my wife, who works in the media industry, monitor financial market information. These programs can scrape data from financial and government websites and then push updates via WeChat. Additionally, I have written other private programs to help her improve work efficiency and earnings.

### 🌟 Featured Projects
I have a deep admiration for engineers who contribute to open-source projects. I have either led or participated in the following open-source projects (listing only a few):
- [Graph Data Lab](https://github.com/ongdb-contrib): This is a team I lead, primarily focused on developing and collecting interesting repositories related to graph data applications.
- [Neo4j](https://github.com/neo4j): I have developed multiple plugins for the Neo4j ecosystem and have supported many other developers in the community.
- [The Graph Foundation](https://github.com/graphfoundation): I have developed multiple plugins for the ONgDB ecosystem and supported developers in deploying causal graph database clusters for training models and other high-performance graph database application scenarios.
- [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai): I have provided code patches for LangChain to improve its performance in the GraphRAG environment.
- [GraphRAG](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag): I have provided patches for Microsoft GraphRAG to enhance its parser performance on Chinese datasets.
- [LLMCompiler](https://github.com/crazyyanchao/llmcompiler): The core code of the LLMCompiler project was contributed by me.
- [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol): I have contributed to the open-source MCP protocol, including but not limited to server code implementation, SDK code implementation and optimization, and documentation improvements.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
I am passionate about AI technology and have a grasp of LLM application development, graph data technology, front-end and back-end technologies. I never set limits for myself and I enjoy using technology to solve practical problems.

### 🖥 Hardware
I enjoy developing on both Linux and Windows platforms.

### 📚 Books I’ve Written
- [《精通Neo4j》](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%B2%BE%E9%80%9ANeo4j): This is a book that I wrote together with friends from the Neo4j community.

### 💼 Work Experience
- From April 2020 to the present, I have been working at a leading public fund management company. My primary responsibilities include data development, knowledge graph platform construction, and LLM application development, specifically applied to the financial asset management sector.
- From May 2017 to April 2020, I worked at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences for three years. My main responsibilities included the development of big data platforms and knowledge graph platform construction, with applications in social media sentiment analysis, multimedia analysis, and related fields.

### 📚 Education
- [Fund Practitioner Qualification](https://gs.amac.org.cn/amac-infodisc/res/pof/person/personDetail.html?accountId=2311031355428237&userId=1700000000699002): I have some experience in the fund industry.
- **Beijing Information Science and Technology University**: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Technology.

I have also obtained various certification certificates, which can be viewed on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanchao-ma-0624b3b7) profile.
